Well, you no longer have to be an expert in Photoshop to do this.</p>  <p>iOS 16 has plenty of awesome new features but Live Objects is probably the best one.  It identifies a prominent or foregrounded item within your photos and can produce cutouts of it automatically, without you having to spend hours on end cropping around it.  </p>",
