This is really great because you usually had to make pretty extensive edits to your dictation after you finished speaking. </p>  ",

With iOS 16, your iPhone will now intelligently add commas, question marks and full stops where appropriate, meaning your stream of consciousness dictation can immediately become easy-to-read prose.</p>",
