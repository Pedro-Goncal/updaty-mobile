Since Apple introduced its Wallet app, there really hasn’t been a need to. </p>  <p>But if you’re student, maybe you’ve needed to because there’s been no way to add your student ID to your iPhone so you’ve needed to always carry your physical card with you.</p>  <p>Well the good news is that Apple has heard your pain and with iOS 16 it’s updated the Wallet app so that you can now add your student ID to it.</p>",

The first thing you need to do is check which app your college is using for virtual ID cards and download this from the App Store. Once in the app, find your institution, select it and log into your school account. </p>  <p>Once logged in, go to your profile and tap the Add to Wallet button, and then follow the instructions presented to add a digital version of your ID to your Apple Wallet. Note that these instructions may vary depending on which app your school is using.</p>  <p>Once complete, you’ll be able to see your student ID in your Wallet and never need to carry a physical wallet around again!</p>",
